\section*{Introduction}

Various tools has been presented in the literature for simple calculations of the decompression wave speed such as GASDECOM \cite{Cosham_GASDECOM}, EPDECOM \cite{Lu2012_EPDECOM} and DECOM \cite{Cosham_DECOM}, which employ the assumption unidimensional isentropic, homogeneous equilibrium and inviscid formulation of the decompression wave without explicitly
solving the fluid transport equations \cite{Liu_2017}. On the other end of the scale  various 1-D/2-D CFD based tools have also been demonstrated where the mass, momentum, and energy balances are explicitly solved \cite{Xu2014_CFDDECOM,OKE20034591_pipetech_CFD,ELSHAHOMI201520_CFD}. Common to all tools is that some are purely academic and some have been developed into commercial products. However, none of the aforementioned tools are freely available to the public. In that respect, the tool presented in the present paper differentiates itself from these tools: it is open source and freely available for use by the public. 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Decompression wave speed}
In RAMDECOM the calculation methodology for the decompression wave speed follows that shown in \cite{GU2018237,Hu2021}. When assuming the decompression wave to be isentropic, in  homogeneous equilibrium and inviscid, the decompression wave speed, $W$, is expressed as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:decompression}
W = C - U 
\end{equation}

where $C$ is the fluid speed of sound and $U$ is the fluid outflow velocity. The outflow velocity is given at any pressure, $P$, by:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:outflow}
U = -\int_{P_0}^{P}{\frac{Cd\rho}{\rho}} = -\int_{P_i}^{P}{\frac{dP}{C\rho}}
\end{equation}

where $P_0$ is the initial pressure and $\rho$ is the fluid density. Integration is performed along an isentropic path. The outflow velocity in the above equation can be expressed by numerical integration using finite difference:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:U_num}
U_i = U_{i-1} + \frac{P_{i-1}-P_i}{C_i \rho_i}
\end{equation}

where the subscript $i$ refers to the current integration step and $i-1$. Properties from the previous step is known, only density and speed of sound needs evaluation at the new step. 

In order calculate the density and the speed of sound, as well as VLE behaviour,  an adequate equation of state is required. In the currect work CoolProp \cite{coolprop} or REFPROP \cite{REFPROP} is used as the thermodynamic back-end. Both tools use Helmholtz energy formulations for fluids modelling both for pure fluids and for mixtures. For pure CO$_2$ the Span-Wagner equation of state is employed \cite{Span2009}, for mixtures the method of Lemmon \cite{Lemmon1999} and Kunz \cite{Kunz2012} is used. For mixtures with CO$_2$ the binary parameters in both CoolProp and REFPROP have been updated with those from EOS-CG \cite{Gernert2016} and later estimations by Herrig \cite{Herrig2018}. 

While the speed of sound is well defined for a single phase fluid, further assumptions are required in order to define it for two-phase / multi-phase. Assuming homogeneous equilibrium the speed of sound can generally be defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sos}
C = \sqrt{\left( \frac{dP}{d\rho}\right)_s} \approx \sqrt{\left( \frac{P_{i-1} - P_i}{\rho_{i-1}-\rho_i}\right)}
\end{equation}

where the differential is evaluated at isentropic conditions. The full calculational workflow is the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define initial conditions: $T_0$, $P_0$ and composition (either pure CO$_2$ or mixture with impurities)
	\item Calculate density and specific entropy using the equation of state
	\item For each integration step from the initial pressure the new pressure $P_i$ is set as $P_{i-1}$ + 1e5 Pa and new density is evaluated via an isentropic path.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The speed of sound, $C_i$, is calculated via Eqn. \ref{eqn:sos} assuming a small $\Delta P$ of 100 Pa. 
		\item $C_i$ is used in Eqn.\ref{eqn:U_num} to calculate the outflow velocity $U_i$
		\item $W_i$ is calculated using Eqn. \ref{eqn:decompression}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The calculations are generally continued until the calculated decompression wave speed becomes zero or negative. The evaluation of properties and estimation of speed of sound is performed at specified pressure and entropy (equal to the initial entropy) i.e. a PS-problem. 

For all calculations the CoolProp python wrapper is used. When using REFPROP as backend this is done still via the CoolProp wrapper. The CoolProp backend is applied only for pure CO$_2$, since the two-phase mixtures failed to solve in many cases. REFPROP can be specified both for pure CO$_2$ and for mixtures. This work is a continuation of a previous work \cite{Andreasen2021} with the purpose of building useful engineering tools on top of high quality open source software packages. RAMDECOM is developed entirely in python 3 and also relies on other python packages such as pandas \cite{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}, matplotlib \cite{Hunter:2007}, and numpy \cite{harris2020array}. 

\subsection{Experimental}
In order to compare the presented decompression model with experimental data various relevant experiments have been sourced from the literature. For decompression of pure CO$_2$ experiments made by Munkejord \emph{et al.} \cite{MUNKEJORD2020118560} and Botros \emph{et al.} \cite{Botros_pure}. For CO$_2$ rich mixtures the experiments from Botros \emph{et al.} \cite{Botros_mixture} has been sourced. 

All the experiments sourced have similar set-up and many things in common. The experiments are performed in a horizontal shock-tube comprised of a number of tubular sections flanged together and equipped with pressure and temperature transducers located along the length of the shock-tube. One end is closed and the other end is equipped with a rupture disc. In order to ensure controllable and uniform temperature the shock-tube is heat traced and insulated. The facilities has mixing and compression units in order to fill the shock tube with the desired mixture and the desired initial pressure. For additional information about experimental methods and facility description and details please refer to the original papers \cite{MUNKEJORD2020118560,Botros_pure}.

The experimental test conditions for the pure CO$_2$ experiments are summarised in Table \ref{tbl:pure_exp} and the experimental test conditions for the CO$_2$ rich mixtures are summarised in Table \ref{tbl:mix_exp}.
