abstract = {HydDown (Andreasen, 2021) is a Python package for calculation of pressure vessel behaviour during filling (pressurisation) or discharge (depressurisation/blow-down). More specifically, the software allows calculation of vessel pressure, fluid inventory temperature as well as vessel wall temperature as a function of time during either filling or discharge operations. The applications are manifold and some examples are: • Rapid filling of vehicle high-pressure hydrogen cylinders • Rapid emergency discharge from high-pressure gas cylinders • Dynamic pressure safety valve behaviour for gas-filled pressure vessels subject to fire heat load A typical system modelled is shown in Figure 1 and it visualizes the key parameters and transport phenomena during gas vessel filling or discharging. The thermodynamic state inside the vessel changes over time as seen from immediately observable variables temperature (T) and pressure (P). This is caused by a change in fluid inventory (density) due to flow of gas either in or out of the vessel. Furthermore, heat is transfered from or to the surroundings via convective heat transfer on the in-and outside of the vessel-with heat being conducted through the vessel wall. The easiest way to explore the basic capabilities fo the code is via the HydDown Streamlit app. Figure 1: Gas-filled pressure vessel subject to gas discharge and heat transfer between vessel and gas inventory.},

abstract = {The design of safe and cost-efficient CO2-transportation systems is an integral part of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) deployment. To achieve this, accurate transient flow models capturing the occurrence of gas, liquid and solid CO2 are needed. These in turn rely on experimental validation. In this work, we present a new experimental facility designed to capture pressure and temperature during the depressurization of CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures in a tube at high spatial and temporal resolution. Experiments with pure CO2 starting from both gaseous and dense (liquid) states are presented, and a reference experiment with N2 is included. The experimental results for both pressure and temperature are analysed by comparison with predictions by a homogeneous equilibrium model. Emphasis is put on the decompression-wave speed, of particular relevance for running-ductile fracture in CO2-transportation pipelines. We observe good agreement with predicted decompression-wave speeds in the single-phase region, and fair agreement for two-phase flows when the calculations are based on the assumption of equilibrium. However, the observed ‘pressure plateau’, a key factor in the prediction of running-ductile fracture, can be significantly lower than that calculated assuming equilibrium.}

abstract = {The pipeline transportation has been considered as the best way to transport pressurized CO2 and plays an important role in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. The risk of ductile fracture propagation increases when a CO2 pipeline is ruptured or punctured, and CO2 decompression behavior must be determined accurately in order to avoid the catastrophic failure of the pipeline and to estimate the proper pipe toughness. Thus in this work, a new decompression model based on GERG-2008 equation of state was developed for modeling the CO2 decompression behavior. And for the first time, a relaxation model was implemented to calculate the sound speed in two-phase region. The model predictions were in excellent agreement with experimental ‘shock tube’ test data in the literature. Furthermore, via modeling, it has been demonstrated how impurities in the CO2 and initial temperatures would affect the CO2 decompression wave speed in various phases. The results obtained show that the effects of these factors on supercritical and gaseous CO2 mixtures are absolutely different while liquid CO2 mixtures behave very similarly when compared to supercritical CO2 mixtures, which indicate that the toughness required to arrest fracture propagation is highly based on the initial phase states of CO2 fluid.}

    abstract = "{Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is one of the technologies that have been proposed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. CCS will require the transportation of the CO2 from the “capture” locations to the “storage” locations via large-scale pipeline projects. One of the key requirements for the design and operation of pipelines in all jurisdictions is fracture control. Supercritical CO2 is a particularly challenging fluid from this point of view, because its thermodynamic characteristics are such that a very high driving force for fracture can be sustained for a long time. Even though CO2 is not flammable, it is an asphyxiating gas that is denser than air, and can collect in low-lying areas. Additionally, it is well known that any pipeline rupture, regardless of the nature of the fluid it is transporting, has a damaging reputational, commercial, logistic, and end user impact. Therefore, it is as important to control fracture in a CO2 pipeline as in one transporting a flammable fluid. With materials specified appropriately for the prevention of brittle failure, the key element is the control of propagating ductile (or tearing) fracture. The determination of the required toughness for the arrest of ductile fracture requires knowledge of the decompression behavior of the contained fluid, which in turn requires accurate knowledge of its thermodynamic characteristics along the decompression isentrope. While thermodynamic models based on appropriate EOS (equations of state) are available that will, in principle, allow determination of the decompression wave speed, they, in general, have not been fully validated for very rapid transients following a rupture. This paper presents experimental results of the decompression wave speed obtained from shock tube tests conducted on pure CO2 from different initial conditions, and comparison with predictions by models based on GERG-2008, Peng-Robinson, and BWRS equations of state (EOS). These tests were conducted as a baseline before introducing various impurities.}",

    abstract = "{Shock tube tests were conducted on a number of binary CO2 mixtures with N2, O2, CH4, H2, CO, and Ar impurities, from a range of initial pressures and temperatures. This paper provides examples of results from these tests. The resulting decompression wave speeds are compared with predictions made utilizing different equations of state (EOS). It was found that, for the most part (except for binaries with H2), the GERG-2008 EOS shows much better performance than the Peng–Robinson (PR) EOS. All binaries showed a very long plateau in the decompression wave speed curves. It was also shown that tangency of the fracture propagation speed curve would normally occur on the pressure plateau, and hence, the accuracy of the calculated arrest toughness for pipelines transporting these binary mixtures is highly dependent on the accuracy of the predicted plateau pressure. Again, for the most part, GERG-2008 predictions of the plateau are in good agreement with the measurements in binary mixtures with N2, O2, and CH4. An example of the determination of pipeline material toughness required to arrest ductile fracture is presented, which shows that prediction by GERG-2008 is generally more conservative and is therefore recommended. However, both GERG-2008 and PR EOS show much worse performance for the other three binaries: CO2 + H2, CO2 + CO, and CO2 + Ar, with CO2 + H2 being the worst. This is likely due to the lack of experimental data for these three binary mixtures that were used in the development of these EOS.}",

abstract = {A mixture model explicit in Helmholtz energy has been developed which is capable of predicting thermodynamic properties of mixtures containing nitrogen, argon, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane, R-32, R-125, R-134a, and R-152a within the estimated accuracy of available experimental data. The Helmholtz energy of the mixture is the sum of the ideal gas contribution, the compressibility (or real gas) contribution, and the contribution from mixing. The contribution from mixing is given by a single generalized equation which is applied to all mixtures studied in this work. The independent variables are the density, temperature, and composition. The model may be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of mixtures at various compositions including dew and bubble point properties and critical points. It incorporates accurate published equations of state for each pure fluid. The estimated accuracy of calculated properties is ±0.2% in density, ±0.1 % in the speed of sound at pressures below 10 MPa, ±0.5% in the speed of sound for pressures above 10 MPa, and ±1% in heat capacities. In the region from 250 to 350 K at pressures up to 30 MPa, calculated densities are within ±0.1 % for most gaseous phase mixtures. For binary mixtures where the critical point temperatures of the pure fluid constituents are within 100 K of each other, calculated bubble point pressures are generally accurate to within ±1 to 2%. For mixtures with critical points further apart, calculated bubble point pressures are generally accurate to within ±5 to 10%.},

    abstract = "{Pipelines can be expected to play a significant role in the transportation infrastructure required for the successful implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS). National Grid is undertaking a research and development programme to support the development of a safety justification for the transportation of carbon dioxide (CO2) by pipeline in the United Kingdom.The ‘typical’ CO2 pipeline is designed to operate at high pressure in the ‘dense’ phase. Shock tube tests were conducted in the early 1980s to investigate the decompression behaviour of pure CO2, but, until recently, there have been no tests with CO2-rich mixtures.National Grid have undertaken a programme of shock tube tests on CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures in order to understand the decompression behaviour in the gaseous phase and the liquid (or dense) phase. An understanding of the decompression behaviour is required in order to predict the toughness required to arrest a running ductile fracture.The test programme consisted of three (3) commissioning tests, three (3) test with natural gas, fourteen (14) tests with CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures in the gaseous phase, and fourteen (14) tests with CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures in the liquid (or dense) phase. The shock tube tests in the liquid (dense) phase are the subject under consideration here.Firstly, the design of the shock tube test rig is summarised. Then the test programme is described. Finally, the results of the dense phase tests are presented, and the observed decompression behaviour is compared with that predicted using a simple (isentropic) decompression model. Reference is also made to the more complicated (non-isentropic) decompression models. The differences between decompression through the gaseous and liquid phases are highlighted.It is shown that there is reasonable agreement between the observed and predicted decompression curves.The decompression behaviour of CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures in the liquid (dense) phase is very different to that of lean or rich natural gas, or CO2 in the gaseous phase. The plateau in the decompression curve is long. The following trends (which are the opposite of those observed in the gaseous phase) can be identified in experiment and theory:• Increasing the initial temperature will increase the arrest toughness.• Decreasing the initial pressure will increase the arrest toughness.• The addition of other components such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen or methane will increase the arrest toughness.}",
